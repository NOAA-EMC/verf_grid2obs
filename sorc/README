Perry,

I have changed your directories to use just the modules they need. To compile code just type makeit in this directory. 

It will clean up and build the source for all the directories in *.fd.

You only generally require 4 user modules above and beyond the system related modules. However sometimes a couple more are needed.

I have also put together a file called "modules" that loads all the ones you gave me in your email. I suspect you do not need most of them in your work.

NOTE: you should use the same module list in the run script that you are using in the compile script. However add one other "module load lsf/10.1"

Good luck,

Jim
